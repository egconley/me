# me
a practice personal website that features fun stuff I'm working on

## stuff I want for my website
* a navbar that collapses into a burger menu, like the homepage of [this](https://www.teachersguild.org) website.

## stuff I want to feature
* interactive animations of my own creation inspired by [this](https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-flocking.html).
